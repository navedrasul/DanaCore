#### Implementation Plan

1. **Solution Architecture Design**:
   - Create a high-level diagram outlining microservices interactions and dependencies.
   - Define data flow, API contracts, and security mechanisms.

2. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - Configure dev containers with required tools and dependencies.
   - Integrate GitHub for version control and Jenkins for pipelines.

3. **Module Development**:
   - Build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, ensuring robust security and scalability.
   - Develop React-based front-end applications for all user modules.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Employ unit testing (JUnit for Java, Jest for React).
   - Conduct security, load, and performance testing.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Containerise applications using Docker.
   - Deploy using Kubernetes, with CI/CD pipelines managed by Jenkins.
