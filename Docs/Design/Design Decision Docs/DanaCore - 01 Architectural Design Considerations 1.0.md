Great! Now that the component diagram is complete, the next steps should focus on detailing the implementation and further refining the architecture:

### 1. **Detailed Component Interactions**
   - **API Endpoints & Data Contracts**: Define specific API endpoints for each microservice. This includes the structure of request and response bodies for each endpoint.
   - **Example**: A report generation endpoint may have:
     - `POST /api/reports/generate`
     - Request: `{ "reportType": "sales", "startDate": "2025-01-01", "endDate": "2025-01-31" }`
     - Response: `{ "status": "success", "reportId": "12345" }`
   - **Message Queue Configuration**: Document the event-driven communication through RabbitMQ (e.g., defining message formats, queues, and listeners).
   - **Security Policies**: Define role-based access policies, like what resources can be accessed by an admin versus an employee.

### 2. **Database Design**
   - **High-Level ER Diagram**: Identify key entities and their relationships (e.g., `User`, `Role`, `Product`, `Order`).
   - **Schema Definition**: Define tables, columns, and relationships (e.g., one-to-many between `User` and `Order`).
   - **Performance Optimization**: Consider indexing, partitioning, or caching strategies.

### 3. **Scalability Considerations**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Define how microservices can scale horizontally, including load balancing and partitioning strategies for the database.
   - **Caching**: Investigate and design for caching mechanisms (e.g., using Redis for frequently accessed data).

### 4. **Security Enhancements**
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Design MFA flows for sensitive actions.
   - **Encryption Policies**: Detail encryption mechanisms for data in transit (TLS) and data at rest (AES-256).
   - **Auditing and Logging**: Define what events and actions will be logged for security auditing.

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **Jenkins Pipelines**: Define Jenkins pipeline stages for building, testing, and deploying the application (e.g., unit tests, Docker container build, deployment to Kubernetes).
   - **Kubernetes Deployment**: Define how containers will be orchestrated, including replication strategies and health checks.

### 6. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - **WCAG Compliance**: Ensure that the React-based frontend adheres to WCAG standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
   - **Testing**: Implement strategies for screen-reader testing and ensuring the UI is fully accessible.

### 7. **Documentation**
   - **API Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).
   - **System Documentation**: Create documentation for system administrators, developers, and users, including deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and maintenance guidelines.

---

Once these areas are defined and documented, we can proceed with **Module Development**, where the first pieces of functionality are built and integrated, ensuring we follow the outlined architecture.  

Would you like to move ahead with defining the specific API endpoints, or would you prefer to focus on any of the other areas?
