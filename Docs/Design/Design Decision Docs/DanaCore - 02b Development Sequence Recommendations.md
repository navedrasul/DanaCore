### **Recommendation: Start with a Multi-App Approach**  
To maximise efficiency and establish a solid foundation, start development with **two sets of apps simultaneously**:  

1. **Record Management App (Core Apps)**  
   - **Reason**: This app establishes the **data schema** and **CRUD operations**, which serve as the foundation for all other modules. Without this, other apps will struggle to handle data effectively.  

2. **Configuration Management App (Administrative Apps)**  
   - **Reason**: It allows early **customisation of workflows, user roles, and settings**, ensuring that the system remains flexible as additional features are developed. This app also ensures the system's adaptability to diverse SME requirements.

### **Benefits of Simultaneous Development**  
1. **Parallel Progress**: While the Record Management App focuses on back-end and database foundations, the Configuration Management App works on enabling customisation logic. These apps have minimal direct dependencies, enabling independent development.  
2. **Cross-App Testing**: Once these two apps are developed, you can test their integration early (e.g., CRUD operations combined with role-based configurations).  
3. **Foundation for Other Apps**: Both apps provide essential structures (data handling and customisation) required by operational, analytical, and service apps.

### **What Comes Next**  
After these apps are functional, prioritise:  
- **User Access Management App**: Adds security and role-based access to the foundation.  
- **Dashboard App**: Provides a centralised, user-facing view of data from the Record Management App.  
- **Sales Management App (Operational Apps)**: Begins addressing high-priority SME business operations.  

This phased approach ensures a stable, scalable, and secure foundation while delivering visible progress to stakeholders.
