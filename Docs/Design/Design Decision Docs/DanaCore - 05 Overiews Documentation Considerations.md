navedrasul: i want to define requirements for the Record Management App.
Clearly list the functionality of each app. For example:
Record Management App: CRUD operations for customers, employees, and inventory.
Identify key workflows and interactions (e.g., adding a new record, updating a workflow).
___
tell me how should i organise the documentation of the requirements? should i create a single document for the entire app or should i create multiple documents based on some criteria? please guide me here!

GitHub Copilot: To organize the documentation of the requirements for the Record Management App, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Single Document for High-Level Overview:**
   - This document should provide an overview of the entire application, including its purpose, scope, and high-level functionalities.
   - Include sections such as Introduction, Objectives, Scope, and High-Level Requirements.

2. **Create Multiple Documents for Detailed Requirements:**
   - Break down the detailed requirements into separate documents based on different modules or functionalities. This makes it easier to manage and update specific parts of the application.
   - For example, you can create separate documents for:
     - Customer Management
     - Employee Management
     - Inventory Management
     - User Authentication and Authorization
     - Reporting and Analytics

3. **Structure Each Detailed Document:**
   - Each document should have a clear structure to ensure consistency and readability. Include sections such as:
     - Introduction
     - Functional Requirements
     - Non-Functional Requirements
     - Key Workflows and Interactions
     - User Interface Requirements
     - Data Requirements
     - Assumptions and Constraints

### Example Structure for a Detailed Document

#### Customer Management Requirements

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief description of the module and its purpose.

2. **Functional Requirements**
   - CRUD operations for customers.
   - Search and filter customers.
   - Import and export customer data.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance requirements (e.g., response time).
   - Security requirements (e.g., data encryption).

4. **Key Workflows and Interactions**
   - Adding a new customer record.
   - Updating an existing customer record.
   - Deleting a customer record.
   - Viewing customer details.

5. **User Interface Requirements**
   - Screens and forms for customer management.
   - Navigation and user experience considerations.

6. **Data Requirements**
   - Data fields for customer records (e.g., name, contact information).
   - Data validation rules.

7. **Assumptions and Constraints**
   - Any assumptions made during the requirement gathering.
   - Constraints that may impact the implementation.

### Example Structure for the High-Level Overview Document

#### Record Management App Overview

1. **Introduction**
   - Purpose of the document.
   - Overview of the Record Management App.

2. **Objectives**
   - Goals and objectives of the application.

3. **Scope**
   - In-scope and out-of-scope functionalities.

4. **High-Level Requirements**
   - Summary of key functionalities for each module (e.g., Customer Management, Employee Management, Inventory Management).

5. **Key Workflows and Interactions**
   - Overview of major workflows and interactions across the application.

By organizing the documentation in this manner, you ensure that each module's requirements are clearly defined and easily accessible. This approach also makes it easier to update specific parts of the documentation without affecting the entire document.
