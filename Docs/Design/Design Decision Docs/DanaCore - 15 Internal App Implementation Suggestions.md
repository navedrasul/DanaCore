You're dealing with a classic modularity challenge in software architecture. You want DanaCore (Folder A) to be able to use different implementations of the "Record Management App API" (Folder B), allowing for flexibility and alternative solutions.  Given this crucial detail, here's a refined approach, acting as an expert Solution Architect:
The Recommended Solution:  Abstract Interface + Dependency Injection (with Git Submodules)
This approach provides the best balance of modularity, maintainability, and version control for your situation.
 * Define a Clear Interface:
   * Within DanaCore (Folder A), create an abstract interface (or abstract class in object-oriented terms) that defines the contract for the "Record Management App API." This interface specifies the methods that DanaCore needs to interact with, like createRecord(), getRecord(), updateRecord(), etc.  Crucially, this interface resides within DanaCore's codebase.  Let's call this interface IRecordManagement.
 * Implementations of the Interface:
   * Your current "Record Management App API" (Folder B) becomes one specific implementation of the IRecordManagement interface.  It will contain concrete classes that implement the methods defined in IRecordManagement.  Let's call this implementation DefaultRecordManagement.
   * Any alternative app that wants to be used with DanaCore must also implement the IRecordManagement interface.  This ensures compatibility.
 * Dependency Injection:
   * DanaCore should not directly instantiate DefaultRecordManagement (or any other concrete implementation).  Instead, it should depend only on the IRecordManagement interface.
   * You'll use a technique called dependency injection to provide the specific implementation to DanaCore at runtime.  This can be done through:
     * Constructor Injection:  Pass an instance of the desired IRecordManagement implementation to DanaCore's constructor.
     * Setter Injection:  Provide a setter method on DanaCore that allows setting the IRecordManagement implementation.
     * Configuration File:  Specify the implementation class in a configuration file (e.g., XML, JSON) that DanaCore reads at startup.
 * Git Submodules for Modularity:
   * Use Git submodules to manage the different implementations of IRecordManagement.
   * Folder B (your DefaultRecordManagement) remains a separate Git repository.  You add it as a submodule to DanaCore (Folder A).
   * If someone creates an alternative implementation (e.g., AlternativeRecordManagement), they would create their own Git repository for it.  You could then easily switch DanaCore to use this alternative by changing the submodule pointer in DanaCore.
Example (Conceptual):
// Interface (in DanaCore - Folder A)
interface IRecordManagement {
    Record createRecord(RecordData data);
    Record getRecord(int id);
    // ... other methods
}

// Default Implementation (Folder B - as a submodule)
class DefaultRecordManagement implements IRecordManagement {
   // ... implementation details
}

// DanaCore (Folder A)
class DanaCoreSystem {
    private IRecordManagement recordManager;

    // Constructor Injection
    public DanaCoreSystem(IRecordManagement manager) {
        this.recordManager = manager;
    }

    public void processRecord(RecordData data) {
        Record record = recordManager.createRecord(data); // Uses the interface
        // ...
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Choose implementation (e.g., based on config)
        IRecordManagement implementation = new DefaultRecordManagement(); // Or AlternativeRecordManagement
        DanaCoreSystem system = new DanaCoreSystem(implementation);
        // ...
    }
}

Advantages:
 * True Modularity: DanaCore is decoupled from specific implementations.
 * Flexibility: Easily switch between implementations by changing the injected object (or the submodule pointer).
 * Maintainability:  Changes to one implementation don't affect DanaCore (as long as the interface is adhered to).
 * Version Control: Git submodules provide proper versioning for each implementation.
 * Testability:  Easier to unit test DanaCore by mocking the IRecordManagement interface.
Implementation Steps:
 * Interface Definition: Start by defining the IRecordManagement interface in DanaCore.
 * Refactor Implementations: Ensure all implementations (including your existing one in Folder B) implement this interface.
 * Dependency Injection: Implement dependency injection in DanaCore.
 * Git Submodules:  Add Folder B (and any future alternative implementations) as Git submodules to DanaCore.
 * Configuration:  Set up a way to configure which implementation DanaCore should use (e.g., configuration file, environment variable).
This approach provides a robust and scalable solution for managing modularity in your system.  It promotes clean code, loose coupling, and easy extensibility.  Remember to thoroughly test your system after making these changes to ensure everything works as expected.
